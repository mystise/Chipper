# Chipper
An incomplete highly modular game engine for the JVM.

Documentation is a TODO. The client works, and there's a lot of useful utilities available, but the server is heavily incomplete and the protocol/networking system is half-baked.

The engine will evolve alongside the projects it is designed for.

Unstable, very unfinished. Hop in #lobby:sleeping.town on Matrix to talk about it.
